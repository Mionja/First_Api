# Description

This is the api laravel of our project at school which is to manage all things around student graduations(especially their marks).
We were given 2 weeks to get the project done and my task in the project is to build the API.

# How to use it

After donwloading it you need to create a database manually in your local server first.
To find the name of the database, check in the .env file and it's the value of DB_DATABASE.

Then, open the downloaded code in a command and type: 

[ php artisan migrate ]

To get all the endpoints of the api, you just need to check it with :

[ php artisan route:list ]

Great, you can now test the api with softwares like postman or the extension thunder client of visual studio code.
